/// Circular surface for the small floating buttons over the message list
/// (scroll up / down, browser downloads).
///
/// iOS 26+: interactive Liquid Glass circle, matching the glass nav-bar
/// buttons. No hand-rolled stroke or shadow — the material draws its own edge
/// and lift, and stacking the old ones reads as a dark halo (FAB finding).
/// `contentShape(Circle())` is required: `.glassEffect` draws a material but
/// contributes no hit-testable shape, so without it only the glyph's pixels
/// would take taps (see [T-fab-glass-contextmenu-regression]).
///
/// Below iOS 26 the original disc is kept byte-for-byte. The light-mode
/// defaults are the [T-ios-scrollbtn-invisible-lightmode] values: a
/// half-transparent white disc was invisible over plain reply text, so the
/// fill is near-opaque with a readable border and shadow. Callers with their
/// own historical values pass them in.

/// The iOS 26 Liquid Glass path is gone: the plan re-derives glass surfaces
/// as milk-pink flat/retro surfaces, and the porcelain card is this set's

///
/// **[T-popup-white-patch 7a0e3d62] — the invariant the fill must keep.**
/// The fill is painted INSIDE a rounded shape, never as a rectangular
/// `.background(color)` + `.clipShape(...)` pair. With that older pairing the
/// host CALayer carried a rectangular backing colour which the system
/// text-selection / edit-menu pop animation snapshotted *before* SwiftUI's mask
/// applied, flashing a square of colour around the rounded corners mid-animation.
/// Filling the shape directly leaves the host layer's `backgroundColor` at
/// `.clear`, so the snapshot is already rounded. `clipShape` is still applied so
/// child views (text view, attachment grid) are clipped to the same rect.
/// The border is `strokeBorder`, drawn inside the shape, for the same reason:
/// it sets no rectangular layer background. Verified on device by
/// long-pressing composer text to raise the edit menu — see the task notes.

/// The hand-rolled shadows are replaced by the one Theme.Shadow.card (the
/// Liquid Glass path used to render its own edge and shadow; stacking the old
/// ones read as a dark halo — the same finding as the FAB conversion).

/// wall) at a visibly higher opacity; dark mode keeps `.plusLighter`, which
/// adds light and never darkens the material. Warning is the Theme accent
/// rose rather than a yellow, which washes out on light surfaces;

/// SwiftUI's already-fragile generic chain on `inputBar.body` and crashes
/// the runtime type-metadata decoder via deep recursion
/// (`swift_getTypeByMangledName...`). Keeping the overlay as a single named
/// struct lets the parent's generic signature collapse to one slot.
///
/// - `progress` 0...1: drag distance as a fraction of the send threshold.
///   Arrow opacity = `min(1, progress * 1.4)`. Capsule opacity ramps in
///   over `[0.4, 0.8]` so it reaches full opacity exactly at the arming
///   fraction (`kSendSwipeArmFraction = 0.8`), where the haptic tick
///   fires and lifting the finger sends.
/// - `armFraction`: the threshold at which release fires send. Drives the
///   spring "pop" animation so the visual confirmation matches behavior.
/// - `location`: live fingertip position in the input bar's coordinate
///   space. The hint sits ~60pt above the finger (about one thumb-tip).
